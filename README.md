#DEEP LEARNING ACTIVITY 1
The activity aims at gaining hands-on experience in image classification and model deployment. Here, we have taken a fruit dataset for the activity that consists of multiple images of apples and bananas.
We aim to create a model that can classify the images correctly using deep-learning neural networks.
