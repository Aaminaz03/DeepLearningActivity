DEEP LEARNING ACTIVITY 1 

The activity aims at gaining hands-on experience in image classification and model deployment. Here, we have taken a fruit dataset for the activity that consists of multiple images of apples and bananas. 

We aim to create a model that can classify the images correctly using deep-learning neural networks.

The process starts by preprocessing the data at hand, building a model, tuning the hyperparameters and then deploying the model.

The Gradio interface is used to upload the images and in return it gives us the accuracy and classifies the image as either apple or banana respectively.
